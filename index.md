Most of my career I have spent working on Research and Development for Internet companies, developing strong expertise in Java web-services architecture.

I support continuous delivery processes, work on defining and implementing standards ranging from the source control collaboration to the release process. 

Working in an international environment for several years now, I have learned a lot about interpersonal relationships and cultural awareness.
